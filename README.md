# ChessGame
Computer implementation of a board game of chess in the C ++ programming language.

The program has two modes: playing with a computer (minmax algorithm) and playing 1 on 1 with a person.
The graphical interface is made using the SFML library. 
To work with the source code, you must install SFML.
To run the game without additional libraries, use the Release version.
